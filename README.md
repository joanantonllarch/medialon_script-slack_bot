# medialon_script-slack_bot
Although bots in general are considered to belong to the "weak" artificial intelligence, using the Slack Web Api to run a Bot with a medialon script could get an useful use.
You need first to create a new app bot in your slack workspace. 
Name it, give capabilities and permissions and install it. 
Save the token to configure and run the script.
